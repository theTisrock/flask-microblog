[What is Microblog]

    A tutorial that uses the building of a blog application to facilitate learning the
    Flask framework [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/ ]. 
    
[How can I run & play around with this application?]

Pre-requisites: 

* Install Git: https://git-scm.com/

* Install Python 3: https://www.python.org/ 
This application uses Python 3.6.7

* Please install pipenv: https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

* Make a new folder in which you wish to have this application run. I call mine "microblog_app"

* Clone this github repository into the directory you just made. Your directory structure should look like - 
    microblog/
        [*.py, *.db, notes, Pipfile, Pipfile.lock, README.md]
        microblog_app/
            templates/
                [html & text files are here]
        migrations/
            [don't touch this]
