flask-wtf: library used to create web forms.

To use this extension, the flask instance "app" object must be configured with a secret key.
*** Protects against cross-site request forgery. ***
implemented in the template as a hidden input inside a form: {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

flash() method
To use this, you must both call the method when the route is called and call get_flashed_messages()
in the template.

validation errors -
Flask-wtf validators that are passed to StringField, PasswordField etc constructors contain an
iterable error list object. Simply call them in the template: form.username.errors, or form.password.errors

url_for -
url_for allows for generating URLs for specific views and enables less fragile code.
If the code is restructured within the filesystem, url_for() will retrieve the URL dynamically.
Just specify the name of the view minus the "html" extension.
so for "dir/dir/dir/index.html" - instead say url_for('index')
