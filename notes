D: = Dependency
* D: flask-wtf: library used to create web forms.

To use this extension, the flask instance "app" object must be configured with a secret key.
*IMPORTANT: Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery. CSRF
implemented in the template as a hidden input inside a form: {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

* flash() method
To use this, you must both call the method when the route is called and call "get_flashed_messages()"
in the template. The way I think of this is that it is placed into a buffer which is loaded
onto the next screen.

* validation errors -
Flask-wtf validators that are passed to StringField, PasswordField etc constructors contain an
iterable error list object. Simply call them in the template: form.username.errors, or form.password.errors

* url_for -
url_for allows for generating URLs for specific views and enables less fragile code.
If the code is restructured within the filesystem, url_for() will retrieve the URL dynamically.
Just specify the name of the view minus the "html" extension.
so for "dir/dir/dir/index.html" - instead say url_for('index')
urls are no longer hardcoded into views

DATABASES: -------------------------------------------------

Workflow:
            1) install dependencies: flask-sqlalchemy, flask-migrate
            2) setup database configuration URL in Config class; turn tracking on/off
            3) instantiate SQLAlchemy object in __init__.py, passing app to the instance
            4) instantiate Migrate object in __init__.py, passing db and app to instance
            5) create models:
                create table schema, optimize performance (create an index), define relationships.
                __repr__(self): define this for debugging
                NOTE: after this step is completed, the model only exists as Python objects.
                      These models need to be migrated (generated into a script),
                      then applied to an actual database.
            6) Initialize migration framework: flask db init
            6) create migration scripts - flask db migrate -m "description"
            7) apply/remove migrations to the database - (apply)flask db upgrade OR (remove) flask db downgrade
            

Models:
            *All classes inside of models.py inherit from the SQLAlchemy class called "Model"
                ex, [SQLAlchemy instance].Model or "class MyModel(db.Model)"

* D: flask-sqlalchemy: (Object Relational Mapper)
    - supports SQLite, MySQL, and Postgres.
    - enables an application to switch from any one of these DBMS systems without
        making changes to the application
    - I am using SQLite as a development-only database for this tutorial.
        may also be a good production tool for gvlswing.com admin CMS since it will be small
        scale and simple for now.

* D: flask-migrate: (Database Migration Framework) Alembic migration framework flask extension
    - The migration framework is for development purposes. Because development often requires making
        changes to the database schema, this framework helps to place those changes, which are tedious
        when performed by hand in SQL

DB indexing - how to decide what to index?
Ask "what attributes will be searched for or written to most frequently?" !!!
This will optimize searching in the database. This would be interesting to test this with/without index.


When using "os.environ.get() or something", this should make the code less fragile and makes
it more flexible for deployment. All that needs to be done is to set an environment variable in production.

    DB MIGRATIONS:----------------------------------------------------
        initialize migration framework: flask db init
            -creates a migrations directory, among other details

        perform a migration: flask db migrate -m "description"
            -generates the python code/script in a file under migrations/
            comment: some of this code seems familiar and similar to Entity Framework,
            upgrade, downgrade, etc.

        apply migration to db: flask db upgrade
            -this will apply the migration to the actual database.
            this should generate the db file in SQLite.

        undo previous migration: flask db downgrade
            -attempts to undo a previous migration.

        db history: flask db history
            -similar to git hist or log

        current db migration: flask db current
            -similar to git status
            -works only if you have applied a migration already



    CRUD operations -------------------------------------------

    CREATE  db.sesssion.add(element)
    READ    [ModelName].query.get(id) or [ModelName].query.all() or [ModelName].query.order_by()
    UPDATE
    DELETE  db.session.delete(element)

    TRANSACTIONS
    COMMIT changes - db.session.commit()
